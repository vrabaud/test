# Generated for NaoQi method ALMotion.angleInterpolationWithSpeed
# Interpolates one or multiple joints to a target angle, using a fraction of max speed. Only one target angle is allowed for each joint. This is a blocking call.

# Name or names of joints, chains, "Body", "BodyJoints" or "BodyActuators".
AL::ALValue names
